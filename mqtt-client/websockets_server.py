WebSocket Real-Time Communication Server

This module implements a high-performance WebSocket server that bridges IoT data
from MQTT sources to Vue.js frontend applications in real-time. It provides
bidirectional communication, client management, and robust error handling
for industrial IoT monitoring systems.

Key Features:
- Asynchronous WebSocket server with concurrent client support
- Real-time data broadcasting to multiple Vue.js frontends
- Automatic client connection management and cleanup
- Bidirectional communication with message echo capabilities
- Thread-safe operations for MQTT integration
- Comprehensive connection monitoring and logging
- Graceful error handling and recovery

Architecture:
    MQTT Client -> Data Processor -> WebSocket Server -> Vue.js Frontend(s)
    
Communication Flow:
    1. Vue.js clients connect via WebSocket protocol
    2. Server maintains active client registry
    3. MQTT data arrives and gets broadcast to all clients
    4. Clients can send commands/requests back to server
    5. Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients

Network Configuration:
    - Default Host: 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
    - Default Port: 8765
    - Protocol: WebSocket (ws://) with ping/pong keepalive
    - Client Capacity: Unlimited (memory permitting)

Integration Points:
    - MQTT payload processor (payload_processing.py)
    - Main IoT gateway (main.py)
    - Vue.js frontend applications

        - >0: Number of active frontend connections
        
Use Cases:
    - System health monitoring
    - Load balancing decisions
    - Resource usage tracking
    - Operational dashboards
    - Capacity planning
    
Thread Safety:
    - Safe to call from any thread
    - No async operations required
    - Atomic read operation
    - No side effects
    
Error Handling:
    - Server not initialized: Returns 0
    - No exceptions thrown
    - Graceful degradation
