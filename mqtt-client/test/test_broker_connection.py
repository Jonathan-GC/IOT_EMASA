MQTT Broker Connection Test Utility

This module provides a simple test utility to verify MQTT broker connectivity
and basic publish/subscribe functionality. Used for validating broker setup
and network connectivity before running IoT simulations.

Key Features:
- MQTT broker connection testing
- Publish/subscribe verification
- Connection status reporting
- Basic message monitoring
- 10-second test cycle

Use Cases:
- Broker connectivity validation
- Network troubleshooting
- MQTT setup verification
- Pre-deployment testing

"""
Test MQTT broker connection and basic functionality.

Performs a comprehensive MQTT broker test including connection,
subscription, publishing, and message reception verification.

Test Sequence:
1. Connect to localhost MQTT broker
2. Subscribe to all topics (#)
3. Publish test message
4. Monitor messages for 10 seconds
5. Report results and disconnect

Connection Parameters:
- Broker: localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Port: 1883 (standard MQTT)
- Keepalive: 60 seconds
- Clean session: True

Test Coverage:
- Connection establishment
- Authentication (if required)
- Topic subscription
- Message publishing
- Message reception
- Network stability

Error Handling:
- Connection failures with error codes
- Exception handling for network issues
- Graceful disconnection
- Status reporting throughout test
